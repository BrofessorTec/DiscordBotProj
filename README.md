 Discord Bot







Melanie's potential project plans: 
  -to create a blacklist function that will temporarily block a user from posting to a channel if they're spamming messages
    -needs to be able to unblock users for now unless we add roles to the functionality where only certain users can reset the blacklist count of a user.
